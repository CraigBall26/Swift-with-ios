# **iOS Regression Test Examples (Swift / XCUI)**

A small collection of example test files taken from a real iOS regression suite built using **Swift** and **XCTest/XCUI**. These examples were originally created while working at **Go‑Ahead**, covering core flows, stable selectors and practical UI‑automation patterns used in production mobile apps.
